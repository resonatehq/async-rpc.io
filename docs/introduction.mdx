## _tl;dr_

*The purpose of this document is to formalize Async RPC, an open, vendor-neutral specification of an asynchronous remote procedure call that is*

- *based on Durable Promises*
- *simple to understand*
- *simple to develop*
- *simple to operate*

## Context

Most distributed applications communicate via synchronous, request-response interactions over connection-oriented protocols such as HTTP or gRPCâ€”an abstraction that crumbles as applications scale across space and time[^1].

## Synchronous RPC

Synchronous RPCs operate on a connection-oriented model where caller and callee share a persistent connection. Request and response must flow over the same connection, creating a tight, transitive spatial and temporal coupling between caller and callee.

- **Scaling across space**

  As the number of executions and therefore the number of persistent connections increases, connections become a point of failure: when the root connection of a subgraph fails, the entire subgraph is lost. A retry initiated by the caller can mitigate the failure, however the entire subgraph, has to be executed again.

- **Scaling across time**

  As the number of executions and therefore the number of persistent connections increases, connections become a point of failure: when the runtime of a subgraph exceeds the lifetime of its root connection, the entire subgraph is lost. A retry initiated by the caller cannot mitigate the timeout, since the entire subgraph will exceed the lifetime again.

## Asynchronous RPC

Asynchronous RPC operates on a message-passing model where caller and callee do not share a persistent transport connection. Request and response may flow over the same or different connections, creating a loose spatial and temporal coupling between caller and callee.

## Structure of the specification

This specification consits of three prescriptive parts:

1. Specification of the [coordination prototcol](/specification/programming-model)
2. Specification of the [recovery protocol](/specification/execution-model)
3. Specification for [message passing](/specification/system-model)
